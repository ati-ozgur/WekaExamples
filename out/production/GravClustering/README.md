GravClustering
==============

Forked from https://github.com/pokonglai/GravClustering.
Code is refactored and changed to learn more about implementation.



A JAVA implementation of the gravitational clustering as described by J Gomez, D Dasgupta and O Nasraoui in their paper "A New Gravitational Clustering Algorithm".
See http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611972733.8 for the original paper.

A 2D visualization of the algorithm can be found in /testers/GravClustering_Tester.java.
For the visualization, SPACEBAR creates a random set of 2D points and ENTER runs the clustering algorithm.
More details can be found in the file which contains the tester class.

For example output and a more detailed overview of the algorithm see http://pokonglai.com/software/gravitational-clustering/
